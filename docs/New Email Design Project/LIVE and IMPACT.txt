TRANSFOORM EMAIL — UI & FUNCTION STATEMENT (DEV)

Core Mental Model

Transfoorm Email has two modes operating on the same data:
	•	Live — safe, continuous, traditional email consumption
	•	Impact — outcome-driven action and resolution

This is not two inboxes.
It is one email system with two action grammars.

Same threads. Same sync. Same storage. Different defaults and affordances.

⸻

Mode Names (UI)

Live | Impact
	•	Live
	•	Conveys streaming, continuity, safety
	•	User will not miss anything
	•	Replaces “Mail” without explanation
	•	Impact
	•	Conveys outcome, agency, consequence
	•	Email is treated as input → action → resolution
	•	Initial friction is intentional and offset by strong affordances

These names are final for UI. Backend naming may differ but must not leak.

⸻

Live Mode (Baseline)

Purpose: Trust + Familiarity
	•	Standard email reading/replying
	•	Thread list + reading pane
	•	Traditional affordances
	•	No pressure to “act”
	•	This mode must feel safe and unsurprising

Live mode exists so users trust the system.

⸻

Impact Mode (Primary Differentiator)

Purpose: Turn email into outcomes

Impact mode applies a different action grammar to the same threads.

Layout (Three-Pane Console)
	•	Left Rail — Resolution Queue
	•	State filters (awaiting_me / awaiting_them / resolved / none)
	•	Thread list
	•	Search
	•	Center — Conversation (Transient)
	•	Chat-style bubbles
	•	Minimal chrome
	•	Reply is secondary, not primary
	•	Right Rail — Intelligence (Primary)
	•	Thread state
	•	AI insights
	•	Linked objects
	•	Temporal data
	•	Sender profile

⸻

The “Big 3” Actions (Impact Mode)

Impact mode exposes exactly three primary actions.
Nothing else is promoted to first-class.

All three are split buttons:
	•	Primary click (≈90%) → fastest, opinionated path
	•	Dropdown (≈10%) → explicit control

1. Promote

Primary action:
→ Promote to Task

Dropdown options:
	•	Promote to Task
	•	Promote to Calendar
	•	Promote to Pipeline
	•	Promote to Note

Intent:
	•	“Promote” means elevate email into work
	•	Intent comes first, destination second
	•	Avoids file/folder metaphors entirely

⸻

2. Link

Primary action (AI-assisted):
→ Link to Project (auto-suggested)

Dropdown options:
	•	Link to Project…
	•	Create New Project
	•	Pin to Timeline / Gantt
	•	Attach to Notes
	•	Reference Only (no state change)

Intent:
	•	Linking provides context, not commitment
	•	Projects are containers of impact, not inboxes

⸻

3. Resolve

Primary action:
→ Resolve Thread

(Default behavior configurable: archive / delete / mark done)

Dropdown options:
	•	Resolve & Archive
	•	Resolve & Delete
	•	Snooze
	•	Mark “No Action”
	•	Undo Resolution (time-boxed)

Intent:
	•	“Resolve” is psychologically final but neutral
	•	Dangerous verbs (Delete) never appear on the main path

⸻

Sacred Constraints (Non-Negotiable)
	1.	Impact mode does not fork data
	•	Same threads, same IDs, same sync
	•	Only UI + defaults change
	2.	No extra primary buttons
	•	Promote, Link, Resolve only
	3.	No folder-first thinking
	•	States and outcomes replace folders
	4.	AI suggests, humans commit
	•	AI never changes state autonomously
	5.	Email is intake, not destination
	•	Inbox is a queue to clear, not a place to live

⸻

One-Sentence Rule for Implementation

Live mode optimizes for trust.
Impact mode optimizes for outcomes.
Both operate on the same email reality.

If implementation violates that sentence, it’s wrong.

⸻

RESPONSIVE MAILBOX RAIL

This is not a user preference and not a feature toggle.

The Mailbox Rail is responsive infrastructure, not interactive UI.

On wide viewports, the Mailbox Rail is rendered as a persistent column.
On narrow viewports, the Mailbox Rail automatically collapses into a header dropdown above the Thread List.

This behavior is:
	•	Breakpoint-driven
	•	Non-configurable
	•	Non-persistent
	•	Not user-controlled

There must be:
	•	❌ No “show/hide mailbox” button
	•	❌ No saved preference
	•	❌ No manual toggle
	•	❌ No animation implying choice

The system decides based solely on available horizontal space.

Rationale:
	•	MacBook Air users already lose width to the global Transfoorm sidebar
	•	Navigation is lower priority than Thread List and Reading Pane
	•	Email scanning and reading must never be width-starved
	•	Cognitive load is reduced when layout adapts without asking

If the Mailbox Rail is treated like a sidebar or user-toggleable panel, the implementation is wrong.

This rule applies only to Live mode.
Impact mode has its own layout logic and is not governed by this constraint.

Canonical Model

Primary container: In Play

This represents active conversational momentum.
It is not a folder, task list, or inbox variant.

⸻

Authoritative States (exclusive)
	•	With Me
Responsibility and next action sit with the user.
	•	With Them
Responsibility is external; user is waiting.
	•	Done
No active momentum. Conversation is finished or archived.

⸻

Why This Is Locked
	•	Language expresses momentum ownership, not urgency or judgment
	•	Terminology is human, neutral, and globally readable
	•	No verbs, no “awaiting”, no productivity theatre
	•	Visual scan is optimized (shared prefix)
	•	Maps cleanly to Live → Impact workflow
	•	Stable for AI, analytics, automation, and future features
