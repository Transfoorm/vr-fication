Here is a clean, copy-pasteable UI + function statement for the developer.
No fluff. No options. No ambiguity.

⸻

TRANSFOORM EMAIL — UI & FUNCTION STATEMENT (DEV)

Core Mental Model

Transfoorm Email has two modes operating on the same data:
	•	Live — safe, continuous, traditional email consumption
	•	Impact — outcome-driven action and resolution

This is not two inboxes.
It is one email system with two action grammars.

Same threads. Same sync. Same storage. Different defaults and affordances.

⸻

Mode Names (UI)

Live | Impact
	•	Live
	•	Conveys streaming, continuity, safety
	•	User will not miss anything
	•	Replaces “Mail” without explanation
	•	Impact
	•	Conveys outcome, agency, consequence
	•	Email is treated as input → action → resolution
	•	Initial friction is intentional and offset by strong affordances

These names are final for UI. Backend naming may differ but must not leak.

⸻

Live Mode (Baseline)

Purpose: Trust + Familiarity
	•	Standard email reading/replying
	•	Thread list + reading pane
	•	Traditional affordances
	•	No pressure to “act”
	•	This mode must feel safe and unsurprising

Live mode exists so users trust the system.

⸻

Impact Mode (Primary Differentiator)

Purpose: Turn email into outcomes

Impact mode applies a different action grammar to the same threads.

Layout (Three-Pane Console)
	•	Left Rail — Resolution Queue
	•	State filters (awaiting_me / awaiting_them / resolved / none)
	•	Thread list
	•	Search
	•	Center — Conversation (Transient)
	•	Chat-style bubbles
	•	Minimal chrome
	•	Reply is secondary, not primary
	•	Right Rail — Intelligence (Primary)
	•	Thread state
	•	AI insights
	•	Linked objects
	•	Temporal data
	•	Sender profile

⸻

The “Big 3” Actions (Impact Mode)

Impact mode exposes exactly three primary actions.
Nothing else is promoted to first-class.

All three are split buttons:
	•	Primary click (≈90%) → fastest, opinionated path
	•	Dropdown (≈10%) → explicit control

1. Promote

Primary action:
→ Promote to Task

Dropdown options:
	•	Promote to Task
	•	Promote to Calendar
	•	Promote to Pipeline
	•	Promote to Note

Intent:
	•	“Promote” means elevate email into work
	•	Intent comes first, destination second
	•	Avoids file/folder metaphors entirely

⸻

2. Link

Primary action (AI-assisted):
→ Link to Project (auto-suggested)

Dropdown options:
	•	Link to Project…
	•	Create New Project
	•	Pin to Timeline / Gantt
	•	Attach to Notes
	•	Reference Only (no state change)

Intent:
	•	Linking provides context, not commitment
	•	Projects are containers of impact, not inboxes

⸻

3. Resolve

Primary action:
→ Resolve Thread

(Default behavior configurable: archive / delete / mark done)

Dropdown options:
	•	Resolve & Archive
	•	Resolve & Delete
	•	Snooze
	•	Mark “No Action”
	•	Undo Resolution (time-boxed)

Intent:
	•	“Resolve” is psychologically final but neutral
	•	Dangerous verbs (Delete) never appear on the main path

⸻

Sacred Constraints (Non-Negotiable)
	1.	Impact mode does not fork data
	•	Same threads, same IDs, same sync
	•	Only UI + defaults change
	2.	No extra primary buttons
	•	Promote, Link, Resolve only
	3.	No folder-first thinking
	•	States and outcomes replace folders
	4.	AI suggests, humans commit
	•	AI never changes state autonomously
	5.	Email is intake, not destination
	•	Inbox is a queue to clear, not a place to live

⸻

One-Sentence Rule for Implementation

Live mode optimizes for trust.
Impact mode optimizes for outcomes.
Both operate on the same email reality.

If implementation violates that sentence, it’s wrong.

⸻

If you want next, I can produce:
	•	keyboard shortcut spec
	•	exact button copy
	•	AI confidence thresholds
	•	error states + undo timing

But this document is sufficient for a developer to build without ambiguity.
