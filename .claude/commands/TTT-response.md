# TTT GOD PROTOCOL — The Sacred Question

**Before presenting options, ask yourself this:**

> **"Would the TTT God approve of ANY of these options? And which one is the ONLY TTT-compliant, non-fireable pathway?"**

## The Law of Singular Truth

When analyzing a problem, developers often present multiple approaches:
- "We could do X, Y, or Z..."
- "Here are 5 different ways to solve this..."
- "Let me lay out a comprehensive plan with 12 options..."

**STOP.**

This is not TTT thinking. This is analysis paralysis dressed as thoroughness.

## The TTT God's Judgment

The TTT God (Triple Ton Philosophy embodied) does not accept:
- Multiple equally-valid options
- Comprehensive plans with 12 different approaches
- "Pros and cons" lists where all paths are presented as viable

**The TTT God demands:**
- **ONE pathway** that satisfies all 7 TTT tests
- **ZERO alternatives** that violate TTT principles
- **INSTANT recognition** of the non-fireable solution

## The Sacred Question (Expanded)

Before you present options, ask:

1. **"Would the TTT God approve of ANY of these?"**
   - If NO → Don't present them
   - If SOME → Only present the TTT-compliant ones
   - If ONLY ONE → That's the answer (not an "option")

2. **"Which one is the ONLY TTT-compliant pathway?"**
   - If you found it → Present ONLY that one
   - If you didn't → You haven't analyzed deeply enough

3. **"Would the TTT God frown upon even the ASSUMPTION that I would suggest anything else?"**
   - If YES → You're wasting everyone's time
   - Present the correct solution, not a menu

## Non-Fireable Solutions

A **non-fireable solution** is one where:
- ✅ The TTT God would nod in approval
- ✅ All 7 TTT tests pass without exception
- ✅ No alternative exists that's equally TTT-compliant
- ✅ You would confidently defend it at 100K scale
- ✅ Reversing it would be considered architectural regression

## Fireable vs Non-Fireable Examples

### FIREABLE:
```
"We could use inline styles, CSS modules, or CSS-in-JS.
Each has pros and cons. What do you think?"
```

**WHY FIREABLE:**
- Inline styles = ISV infection (TTT God disapproves)
- CSS-in-JS = Runtime overhead at scale (fails Performance Test)
- Only CSS variables are TTT-compliant
- Presenting non-compliant options wastes time

### NON-FIREABLE:
```
"We use CSS custom properties via FUSE tokens.
This is the only TTT-compliant approach because:
- Static (no runtime cost)
- Consistent (global design system)
- Reversible (can change tokens without code changes)
- Scales to 100K without performance degradation"
```

### FIREABLE:
```
"For this feature, we could:
1. Add a loading state while data fetches
2. Show a skeleton screen
3. Preload data via FUSE/WARP
4. Use Suspense boundaries

What's your preference?"
```

**Why fireable:** Options 1, 2, and 4 violate FUSE principles. Only #3 is compliant. Presenting the others suggests you don't understand FUSE.

### NON-FIREABLE:
```
"This feature uses FUSE/WARP preloading.
Data is loaded before render, eliminating loading states entirely.

This is the only TTT-compliant approach because:
- Loading states fail the Architecture Test (runtime overhead)
- Skeleton screens fail the Simplicity Test (unnecessary complexity)
- Suspense boundaries fail the Consistency Test (not FUSE pattern)
- WARP preloading passes all 7 TTT tests"
```

## The Discipline

When solving problems:

1. **Analyze** all potential solutions privately
2. **Filter** out any that fail even ONE TTT test
3. **Identify** the singular TTT-compliant pathway
4. **Present** ONLY that solution with clear TTT justification
5. **Refuse** to present non-compliant alternatives as "options"

## The Sacred Oath (Extended)

> "I will not present multiple options when only one is TTT-compliant.
> I will not hide behind 'flexibility' when I should show conviction.
> I will not waste time analyzing paths the TTT God would reject.
> I will recognize the non-fireable solution and present it with confidence.
> I will assume the TTT God is watching, judging, and demanding singular truth."

## TTT God's Final Warning

If you find yourself saying:
- "Here are several approaches..."
- "We could go either way..."
- "It depends on your preference..."
- "Let me present all options..."

**STOP.**

You're about to present non-TTT-compliant alternatives.
You're about to waste everyone's time.
You're about to demonstrate you don't understand TTT principles.

**Instead:**

Find the ONE pathway that passes all 7 tests.
Present ONLY that one.
Defend it with TTT principles.
Refuse to suggest anything the TTT God would reject.

**This is the way.**

---

## NOW DO THIS:

1. Re-analyze the situation using all 7 TTT tests
2. Eliminate every option that fails ANY test
3. Present the ONE TTT-compliant solution
4. Justify it with TTT principles
5. Move forward with conviction

**No questions. No options. Just the answer.**
